## Overview

Traditional grading schemes award points on each assignment and course grades are determined through a weighted average of those points. This can lead to students asking questions like ‚Äúwhat do I need to do to get an A in this course?‚Äù when we really want students to focus on the learning and not the points. Non-traditional grading seeks to redefine the relationship between grading and learning by realigning grades with course activities. In this workshop, we will discuss the key components of non-traditional grading schemes and provide participants with a foundation for implementing a non-traditional system in their course.  

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to (or have):

- Articulate the key characteristics of non-traditional grading systems.
- Identify hurdles students and you may encounter with non-traditional grading systems.
- Practice writing measurable learning outcomes for one topic of a course or specifications for one assignment.
- Make significant progress toward the construction of a system for one of their courses (or assignments) via a scaffolded interactive activity


## Prework

Please bring a current syllabus and example assignments from a course that you would like to discuss. This will be helpful for converting current materials to a non-traditional framework. This could be electronic (encouraged to bring a tablet or laptop) or a hard copy to markup.

No prior knowledge is necessary; however, you will benefit from having identified a particular course you would like to focus on during the workshop.
