This can lead to students asking questions like ‚Äúwhat do I need to do to get an A in this course?‚Äù when we really want students to focus on the learning and not the points. Non-traditional grading seeks to redefine the relationship between grading and learning by realigning grades with course activities. In this workshop, we will discuss the key components of non-traditional grading schemes and provide participants with a foundation for implementing a non-traditional system in their course.\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:\nArticulate the key characteristics of non-traditional grading systems.\nIdentify hurdles students and faculty may encounter with non-traditional grading systems.\nPractice writing measurable learning outcomes for one topic of a course or specifications for one assignment.\nMake significant progress toward the construction of a system for one of their courses (or assignments) via a scaffolded interactive activity\nPrework\nParticipants will want to bring a current syllabus and example assignments from a course they would like to discuss. This will be helpful for converting current materials to a non-traditional framework. This could be electronic (encouraged to bring a tablet or laptop) or a hard copy they prefer to markup.\nNo prior knowledge is necessary; however, participants will benefit from having identified a particular course they would like to focus on during the workshop.\nSchedule\nTime\nActivity\n01:00 - 01:45\nIntroduction and overview\n01:45 - 02:45\nWriting measurable goals\n02:45 - 03:15\n\n03:30 - 13:30\nCoffee break\ntimes\nActivity\ntimes\nActivity\ntimes\n\nMaterials\nSlides\nSlide deck for the day\nGuides\nActivity handout\nAny templates, etc.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank‚Ä¶\nThis is a website made with the distill package.\n\n\n\n",
