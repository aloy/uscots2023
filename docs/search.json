This can lead to students asking questions like ‚Äúwhat do I need to do to get an A in this course?‚Äù when we really want students to focus on the learning and not the points. Non-traditional grading seeks to redefine the relationship between grading and learning by realigning grades with course activities. In this workshop, we will discuss the key components of non-traditional grading schemes and provide participants with a foundation for implementing a non-traditional system in their course.\nBy the end of the workshop, you will be able to (or have):\nArticulate the key characteristics of non-traditional grading systems.\nIdentify hurdles students and you may encounter with non-traditional grading systems.\nPractice writing measurable learning outcomes for one topic of a course or specifications for one assignment.\nMake significant progress toward the construction of a system for one of their courses (or assignments) via a scaffolded interactive activity\nPrework\nPlease bring a current syllabus and example assignments from a course that you would like to discuss. This will be helpful for converting current materials to a non-traditional framework. This could be electronic (encouraged to bring a tablet or laptop) or a hard copy to markup.\nNo prior knowledge is necessary; however, you will benefit from having identified a particular course you would like to focus on during the workshop.\nTentative schedule\nTime\nActivity\n1:00 - 1:45\nIntroduction and overview\n1:45 - 2:30\nWriting measurable goals\n2:30 - 3:00\nBreak!\n3:00 - 4:15\nBuilding a syllabus\n4:15 - 4:30\nWrap up\nMaterials\nSlide deck\nCollaborative notes\nWorksheets\nAssesing Student Work\nBuilding a Syllabus\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank‚Ä¶\nThis is a website made with the distill package.\n\n\n\n",
